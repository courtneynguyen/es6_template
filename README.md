# ES6 Node.js Template
This repository is designed to give a quick and easy template to start off. It leverages ES6 technology, and uses a nodemon to detect changes, and restarts the server changes for you. This means making changes to the server restarts itself for you, so then all the client has to do is refresh. 

## Installation
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
